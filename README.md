# Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms "Comparison of LLE and Modified LLE"

This is the course project of the Advanced Machine Learning (AdML) course at EPFL (MICRO-570).<br>

The goal of this project was to compare the perfromance of the LLE and MLLE nonlinear dimiensionality reduction techniques.
The Python implementation and the project report are accessible in this repository.<br>
